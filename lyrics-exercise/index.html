            <h3>[Verse 1: Joji]</h3>
            <p>Lately, I've been slippin' away from you<br>
                Can you tell me, does it hurt today?<br>
                Yeah, there's no way, yeah (No way, no way, no way)<br>
                To burn, there's no flames, yeah (There's no flames)<br>
                Praying nine to five like a saint for you (Like a saint)<br>
                Can you tell me how it turned this way? (How?)<br>
                Yeah, things have changed, yeah (Yeah)<br>
                Yeah, filled with rage, yeah (Filled with rage)</p>
        
            <h3>[Chorus: Joji]</h3>
            <p>So lost in these diamonds<br>
                So lost in this paradise<br>
                Don't speed on that highway<br>
                We need you to shine bright<br>
                When life gets too complicatеd<br>
                Will you stand with me after dark?<br>
                I will stay in the limеlight<br>
                Like a beautiful afterthought<br>
                Like a beautiful afterthought</p>
        
            <h3>[Verse 2: BENEE]</h3>
            <p>Sometimes, you'd ask me for something different<br>
                Hated when you did it, I wish that you didn't<br>
                I would do things and you'd get annoyed, I<br>
                Should've never done them, I wish I was different<br>
                Why do we have to step away now?<br>
                It's been a year, been a couple days now<br>
                Since you called me sayin' you're worried<br>
                Been hard for me dealin' with this space now<br>
                No company, wishin' we could sit down<br>
                'Cause I'm sorry, but you don't want me</p>

            <h3>[Chorus: Joji]</h3>
            <p>So lost in these diamonds<br>
                So lost in this paradise<br>
                Don't speed on that highway<br>
                We need you to shine bright<br>
                When life gets too complicated<br>
                Will you stand with me after dark?<br>
                I will stay in the limelight<br>
                Like a beautiful afterthought<br>
                Like a beautiful afterthought</p>

            <h3>[Outro: BENEE & Joji]</h3>
            <p>I don't wanna forget about you<br>
                I don't wanna forget about you, oh<br>
                I don't wanna forget about you<br>
                I don't wanna think about it<br>
                Think about it</p>

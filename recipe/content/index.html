                <h2>3 recipe websites</h2>
                <h3><a href="https://www.simplyrecipes.com/" target="_blank">Simply Recipes</a></h3>
                    <p>Simply Recipes has a "Jump to Recipe" button, which is extremely useful. Although each recipe has a long introduction, this button allows for those short on time to skip the introduction and go straight to the ingredients and directions. There are also images for each direction step which is helpful.</p>
                <h3><a href="https://www.epicurious.com/" target="_blank">Epicurious</a></h3>
                    <p>Compared to the other two recipe websites, Epicurious has a minimalistic design. There's only one big image at the top of each recipe page, with a shorter introduction so those following along can jump straight to the ingredients and directions without reading through a long introduction like the other websites.</p>
                <h3><a href="https://www.allrecipes.com/" target="_blank">Allrecipes</a></h3>
                    <p>One thing that makes Allrecipes different from other recipe sites is that they have checkmarks next to each step. This allows those following along to check off each step as they go through their cooking process.</p>
